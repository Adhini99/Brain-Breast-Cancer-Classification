# Brain & Breast Tumor Detection with Trigonometric Convolutions

1. Preprocessing Tumor Data: Prepare MRI and mammogram images and masks for classification and segmentation tasks.

2. TrigConv2D Layer Design: Integrate sinusoidal kernels to capture structural and textural features of tumors.
   
3. Classification Segmentation Models: Build TrigConv-based models for brain/breast tumor detection using custom U-Net andÂ classifiers.
